*GraphNeuralNetworks* is a graph neural network library for Julia based on the [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) deep learning framework.

Some of its noticeable features are the following:

* Based on the Flux deep learning framework.
* CUDA support.
* Integrated with the JuliaGraphs ecosystem.
* Supports generic graph neural network architectures.
* Easy to define custom graph convolutional layers.

## Installation

```julia
]add GraphNeuralNetworks
```

## Usage

Usage examples can be found in the `examples/` folder.
