# Datasets

GNN.jl doesn't come with its own datasets, but leverages those available in the julia (and non-julia) ecosytem. In particular, the [examples in the GNN.jl repository](https://github.com/CarloLucibello/GraphNeuralNetworks.jl/tree/master/examples) make use of the [MLDatasets.jl](https://github.com/JuliaML/MLDatasets.jl) package. There you will find common graph datasets sich as Cora, PubMed, and Citeseer.
Also MLDatasets gives access to the [TUDataset](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/docs/datasets/) repository and its numerous datasets.
